📘 HTML Fundamentals & History
🧠 What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every webpage. It defines the structure and meaning of content so browsers know how to display it.

It tells the browser:

What is a heading (<h1>)

What is a paragraph (<p>)

What is an image (<img>)

And much more...

📌 Basic HTML Example
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World 🌍</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage!</p>
  </body>
</html>
Tag	Purpose
<!DOCTYPE>	Declares the document as HTML5
<html>	Root element of the page
<head>	Contains metadata, links, SEO info, and scripts
<title>	Sets the title shown in the browser tab
<body>	Holds all visible content on the page
📚 Why HTML Is Used
Structure: Organizes content into readable sections.

Semantics: Tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <footer> add meaning.

Accessibility: Helps screen readers and assistive tech interpret content.

SEO: Semantic tags and metadata improve search engine visibility.

Interoperability: Works across all browsers and devices. CSS styles it. JavaScript adds interactivity.

🧩 What Goes Inside the <head> Tag?
The <head> section contains metadata and resources that help browsers understand and render the page correctly.

✅ Common <head> Elements
Tag	Purpose
<title>	Sets the page title in the browser tab
<meta>	Provides metadata (charset, description, keywords, viewport, etc.)
<link>	Links external resources (CSS, favicon)
<style>	Embeds internal CSS styles
<script>	Loads JavaScript files (use defer or async for performance)
<base>	Sets base URL for relative links
<noscript>	Fallback content if JavaScript is disabled
🧪 Example Head Section
html
<head>
  <title>Rahul's Portfolio</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Full-stack projects and electronics builds by Rahul">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">
  <script src="app.js" defer></script>
</head>
🚀 Bonus Tip for Devs
When deploying on platforms like Render, make sure your <head> includes:

Proper <meta> tags for mobile responsiveness

External CSS and JS links with correct paths

SEO-friendly title and description

Favicon for branding
